# Url-Shortener
A URL shortener is a web service that takes a long URL and converts it into a shorter, more manageable link. The primary purpose of URL shorteners is to make links more shareable and easier to distribute, particularly on social media platforms or when character count is limited, such as in SMS or Twitter posts.
